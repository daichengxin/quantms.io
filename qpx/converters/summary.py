"""Conversion summary — a concise report of a produced QPX dataset.

Emitted at the end of every ``qpxc convert <tool>`` run so the operator sees, at
a glance, what the conversion produced: row counts for the PSM / feature / pg
views, the number of distinct peptidoforms (and, when cheap, proteins and
genes), plus feature->pg link diagnostics built on the computed softlink
(:meth:`qpx.dataset.Dataset.link_feature_pg`).

The link diagnostics surface the *identified-but-not-quantified* reading: a
feature with no pg link (:meth:`~qpx.dataset.Dataset.features_without_pg_link`)
was identified but contributes to no protein-group quantity — e.g. a shared
feature that does not feed a proteotypic-only protein quantity.

Everything is computed with DuckDB ``COUNT`` / ``COUNT(DISTINCT ...)`` over the
registered views (fast, and identical on the local and S3 read paths); whole
tables are never pulled into Python. Each metric is guarded for the view being
absent, since a conversion may produce only some structures.
