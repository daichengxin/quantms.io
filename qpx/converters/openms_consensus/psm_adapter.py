Each ``PeptideIdentification`` (assigned to a consensus feature or unassigned) is

``[peptidoform, charge, run_file_name, scan]``. The run is resolved from the
identification's global ``map_index`` (→ the map's file), the parent consensus
feature's element runs, or — for an unassigned ID in a merged multi-run
consensusXML — its ``id_merge_index`` (→ the i-th merged MS run, see
