"""Shared read-back + assertions for the feature<->pg softlink round-trip checks.

The feature->pg association is a *computed softlink* (bigbio/qpx#269): converters
no longer materialize ``feature.pg_ids``; ``Dataset.link_feature_pg()`` derives it
on read via a label-aware join of the registered ``feature`` and ``pg`` views.
These helpers open a converted dataset, run the softlink, and assert every
``(feature_id, pg_id, label)`` edge is a real pg row whose canonical
``pg_accessions`` membership equals the feature's, whose ``grouped_runs`` contains
the feature's ``run_file_name``, and whose ``label`` is one of the labels the
feature actually carries (so a feature never over-links to a same-membership pg
row for a channel it lacks).
