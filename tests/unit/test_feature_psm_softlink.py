"""Unit tests for the computed feature<->psm inverse softlink (bigbio/qpx#267).

``psm.feature_id`` is the authoritative (optional) foreign key and stays
materialized; its inverse, ``feature.psm_ids``, is NOT materialized — it is
computed on read by ``Dataset.link_feature_psm()`` (group the persisted
``psm.feature_id`` by feature). These tests build tiny synthetic datasets
directly so the inverse and its complement can be asserted without any converter.
